# AI-NPC Launcher

AI-NPC Launcher is a Minecraft mod that launches and controls the AI-NPC client, enabling you to create and interact with NPCs that can move, mine, and chat with players in the game. This mod serves as the launcher for the [AI-NPC](https://github.com/sailex428/AI-NPC) client, which powers the actual NPC functionality. Currently, the AI-NPC's capabilities include basic movement, mining actions, and chatting with players.

> **Note**: This project is under active development. Future updates will expand the NPCs capabilities.
