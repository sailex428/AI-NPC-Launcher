# AI NPCs

AI-NPC Launcher is a Minecraft mod that launches and controls the AI-NPC client, enabling you to create and interact with NPCs that can move, mine, and chat with players in the game. This mod serves as the launcher for the [AI-NPC](https://github.com/sailex428/AI-NPC) client, which powers the actual NPC functionality. Currently, the AI-NPC's capabilities include basic movement, mining actions, and chatting with players.

2. **Spawn NPCs**:
    - Use the `/npc add <npcname> <isOffline> <openai|ollama> <llm model>` command to create an NPC. (Example: `/npc add sailex428 true openai gpt-4o-mini`) (at this point only openai is supported)

## Setting Up LLM Integration  

### **Option 1: OpenAI API Key (Paid)**  

1. **Create an Account**: 
   - Sign up or log in to [OpenAi](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   
2. **Purchase Credits**:
   - Navigate to [Billing](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)
   - Add a payment method and add credits to your balance
   
3. **Generate an API Key**: 
   - Navigate to [api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
   - Click on the top right on "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the api-key
   
5. **Add the API Key to the Mod**:
   - Use `/setconfig npc.llm.openai.api_key <your_api_key>` in-game to set the key.  

### **Option 2: Ollama (Local LLM)**  

#### What is Ollama?  
Ollama is a local LLM platform for running AI models directly on your machine, reducing reliance on external APIs.  

#### Installation Steps  
1. **Download Ollama**:

2. **Install and Run Ollama**:  
   - Follow the setup instructions to install.  
   - Start Ollama and ensure it's running in the background.  

3. **Connect to the Mod**:  
   - Use the `/npc add` command with `ollama` as the model type.  
   - Example: `/npc add npcname true ollama llama-2`
   - if your server runs on a diffrent address you can set that via `/setconfig npc.llm.ollama.url <youre server address>`.
